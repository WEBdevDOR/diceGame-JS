# Dice Game
My first ever JavaScript  project.
## following The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp on udemy.com

Although I have downloaded the starting folder, that did not contain any .js file or links. 

- I've read the instruction
- Created the project
- Read through the solution and made minor adjusments

I didn't need to refactor my code that much. That was a pleasant surprise - understanding I CAN do it,
and in the correct convention :)
